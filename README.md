### Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Marcia Rodrigues, and this repository showcases my work and studies in Data Science and Software Engineering.

About me:

🎓 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering and a postgraduate specialization in Artificial Intelligence, both focused on industrial and applied technologies.

💡 I’ve been working with Data Science and Machine Learning since 2020, developing end-to-end data solutions, from data ingestion and modeling to deployment and visualization.

⚙️ Skilled in Python, SQL, PySpark, Airflow, and Databricks, with experience in Docker, AWS, and Azure for scalable data processing and automation.

🌍 Currently pursuing the Erasmus Mundus Master’s in Software Engineering with a Sustainability track, combining advanced software engineering with sustainable systems design.
